                            My journey has been a bit all over the place, but I wouldn't change it for anything! I'm all for taking risks and trying new things, 
                            and would recomend everyone to do that as well! You never know where life can take you, if you give it a chance. I've been able to 
                            meet, work with, struggle with and win-big with so many incredible people! These people and moments being the sugar and spice of who I am today!
